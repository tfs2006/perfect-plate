# Deployment Summary

## Overview
This pull request successfully implements comprehensive Gemini API configuration support with full Vertex AI compatibility and security best practices.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Endpoints (3 files modified/created)

#### ✅ `netlify/functions/health-check.js` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Verify API configuration before use
- **Endpoint**: `/.netlify/functions/health-check`
- **Features**:
  - Checks API key configuration
  - Validates endpoint type (Vertex AI or Generative Language)
  - Tests model availability
  - Returns detailed status report
  - Provides troubleshooting information

#### ✅ `netlify/functions/generate-plan.js` (UPDATED)
- **New Features**:
  - Dual endpoint support (Vertex AI + Generative Language API)
  - Model override via `GEMINI_MODEL` environment variable
  - Enhanced logging (endpoint, model, masked API key)
  - Automatic model availability checking
  - Handles both endpoint URL structures

#### ✅ `netlify/functions/list-models.js` (UPDATED)
- **New Features**:
  - Supports both endpoint types
  - For Vertex AI: Returns common models (list endpoint not available)
  - For Generative Language: Lists all available models
  - Shows endpoint type in response

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration

Four environment variables control the API configuration:

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | - | Your API key (Vertex or Generative Language) |
| `GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT` | ❌ No | `generativelanguage` | Endpoint type: `vertex` or `generativelanguage` |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | ❌ No | Uses frontend default | Model override (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | ❌ No | `*` | CORS allowed origins |

### 3. Documentation (5 new/updated files)

#### ✅ `README.md` (UPDATED)
- Added comprehensive "API Key Setup" section
- Documented both endpoint options
- Added health-check endpoint to troubleshooting
- Environment variables reference
- Model selection priority explanation

#### ✅ `API_CONFIG_GUIDE.md` (NEW)
- Quick reference guide
- TL;DR sections for both endpoints
- Configuration examples
- Testing instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Common configuration patterns

#### ✅ `.env.example` (NEW)
- All environment variables documented
- Detailed comments
- Multiple configuration examples
- Security warnings
- Netlify setup instructions

#### ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md` (NEW)
- Complete feature verification
- Code quality checks
- Testing recommendations
- Deployment checklist
- Requirements fulfillment matrix

#### ✅ `SECURITY_NOTE.md` (NEW)
- API key management best practices
- What to do if key is exposed
- Security measures implemented
- Documentation best practices
- Key rotation procedures

### 4. Security Enhancements

✅ **No real API keys in code or documentation**
- All examples use safe placeholders
- Real key only used via environment variables

✅ **Automatic API key masking in logs**
- Shows first 10 and last 4 characters only
- Example: `AQ.YOUR_VER...HERE`

✅ **API keys never exposed to frontend**
- All API calls through serverless functions
- Keys only accessible to backend

✅ **CORS protection**
- Configurable allowed origins
- Prevents unauthorized access

✅ **Environment isolation**
- `.env` files excluded from git
- Keys stored securely in Netlify

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables**

Add the following variables:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY = [Your actual Vertex AI API key - starts with AQ.]
GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT = vertex
GEMINI_MODEL = gemini-2.5-flash-lite
ALLOWED_ORIGIN = [Your GitHub Pages URL or leave as *]
```

**Important**: Never commit your actual API key to code. Only set it in Netlify's environment variables dashboard.

**Note**: Your actual Vertex AI API key should be obtained from Google Cloud Console and set in Netlify's secure environment variables. It is NOT stored in this repository for security reasons.

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

Merge this pull request or deploy the branch to Netlify. The changes will automatically be deployed.

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

Visit your health-check endpoint:
```
https://[your-site].netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health-check
```

You should see a response like:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "configuration": {
    "apiKey": "AQ.YOUR_VER...HERE",
    "endpointType": "vertex",
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
  },
  "tests": {
    "vertexModelAccess": "SUCCESS",
    "modelAvailable": true
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Application

1. Open your Perfect-Plate application
2. Fill in the meal planning form
3. Generate a meal plan
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Verify the meal plan is generated successfully

### Step 5: Check Function Logs (Optional)

In Netlify Dashboard:
1. Go to: **Functions → generate-plan**
2. Click **Logs**
3. Look for entries showing:
   ```
   [Gemini Proxy] Using vertex endpoint: https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/publishers/google/models/
   [Gemini Proxy] Model endpoint: gemini-2.5-flash-lite:generateContent
   [Gemini Proxy] API Key: AQ.YOUR_VER...HERE
   ```

## Features Implemented

### ✅ All Requirements from Problem Statement

1. ✅ **Set the Netlify environment variable** - Documented and supported
2. ✅ **Support Vertex AI endpoint** - Full implementation with runtime switching
3. ✅ **Support legacy/Generative Language API** - Both endpoints supported
4. ✅ **Replace unsupported models** - Model override via environment variable
5. ✅ **Add documentation** - Comprehensive docs created
6. ✅ **Test backend endpoint** - Health-check endpoint created
7. ✅ **Show logs of endpoint/model/API key** - Enhanced logging implemented
8. ✅ **Runtime switch for endpoints** - Via GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT variable
9. ✅ **Health check endpoint** - Verifies model/endpoint/API key combinations

### ✅ Additional Features

- ✅ Backward compatible with existing frontend
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Multiple documentation formats (README, quick guide, security notes)
- ✅ Syntax-checked and code-reviewed

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Health-check endpoint returns valid configuration
- [ ] List-models endpoint shows available models
- [ ] Meal plan generation works
- [ ] Function logs show correct endpoint and model
- [ ] API key is properly masked in logs
- [ ] No errors in browser console

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check health-check endpoint first** - It will show configuration status
2. **Verify environment variables** - Make sure they're set in Netlify
3. **Check function logs** - Look for detailed error messages
4. **Review documentation** - See README.md and API_CONFIG_GUIDE.md
