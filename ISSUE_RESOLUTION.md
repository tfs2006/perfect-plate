# Issue Resolution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Issue:** Multiple errors preventing meal plan generation

## Problems Identified

The error logs showed several issues:

1. **Critical: Model Not Found Error (404)**
   ```
   API error (404): {
     "error": {
       "code": 404,
       "message": "models/gemini-1.5-pro-001 is not found for API version v1, or is not supported for generateContent."
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Warning: Tailwind CDN in Production**
   ```
   cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production
   ```

3. **Warning: Custom Element Already Defined**
   ```
   Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined
   ```

4. **Error: Missing Favicon**
   ```
   Failed to load resource: /favicon.ico (404)
   ```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Model Name (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** The code was using `gemini-1.5-pro-001` which is not a valid model identifier for the Gemini API v1.

**Solution:** Changed all references from `gemini-1.5-pro-001` to `gemini-1.5-pro`

**Files Changed:**
- `js/script.js` - 9 occurrences updated
- `test-api.html` - 4 occurrences updated  
- `README.md` - Documentation updated

**Impact:** This was the root cause of the 404 errors. The meal plan generation should now work correctly.

### 2. ✅ Added Favicon

**Problem:** Browser was requesting `/favicon.ico` which didn't exist, causing 404 errors.

**Solution:** Added favicon link in HTML header pointing to existing `assets/favicon.png`

**Files Changed:**
- `index.html` - Added `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="assets/favicon.png" />`

**Impact:** Eliminates favicon 404 errors in browser console.

### 3. ℹ️ Tailwind CDN Warning (EXPECTED)

**Problem:** Browser console shows warning about using Tailwind CDN in production.

**Status:** This is **expected** and documented in the code comments as "Tailwind (CDN for now)".

**Why it's acceptable:**
- This is a simple static site deployed on GitHub Pages/Netlify
- The CDN approach is fast and doesn't require a build process
- Performance impact is minimal for this use case
- The warning is informational, not an error

**Future improvement:** If the project grows or performance becomes critical, consider:
1. Installing Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin
2. Using the Tailwind CLI for a build step
3. See: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

### 4. ℹ️ Web Components Custom Element Error (BROWSER EXTENSION)

**Problem:** Console shows error about custom element `mce-autosize-textarea` already being defined.

**Status:** This is **not caused by the application code**.

**Root Cause:** This error comes from:
- A browser extension (likely a text editor or form helper)
- The extension is trying to register a custom element that's already registered
- Common with extensions that enhance text areas

**Why it's safe to ignore:**
- The error originates from `webcomponents-ce.js` and `overlay_bundle.js` which are not part of this application
- The application doesn't use or define any custom elements
- This won't affect meal plan generation functionality

**User Action:** Users can disable browser extensions one by one to identify which one is causing this, but it's not necessary for the app to function.

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes:

1. **Use the Diagnostic Tool** (`test-api.html`):
   - Open test-api.html in your browser
   - Run "Simple Test" to verify API connectivity
   - Run "List Models" to confirm `gemini-1.5-pro` is available
   - All tests should now pass with the correct model name

2. **Test Meal Plan Generation**:
   - Open index.html in your browser
   - Fill out the form with test data
   - Generate a meal plan
   - Should complete without 404 model errors

3. **Check Console**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - You should see:
     - ✅ No 404 errors for favicon
     - ✅ No 404 errors for the Gemini model
     - ℹ️ Tailwind CDN warning (expected, safe to ignore)
     - ℹ️ Possible web components error (from browser extension, safe to ignore)

## Summary

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Model 404 Error | ✅ Fixed | Critical - was blocking all functionality |
| Missing Favicon | ✅ Fixed | Minor - just console noise |
| Tailwind CDN Warning | ℹ️ Expected | None - informational only |
| Web Components Error | ℹ️ External | None - from browser extension |

The **critical issue** (model 404 error) has been resolved. The meal plan generation functionality should now work correctly.
